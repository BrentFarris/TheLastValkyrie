TBD
- Pure encapsulation
- Memory ownership
- Avoid void*
- No need for typedef
- Don't over-complicate strings
- Use utf8 strings
- Don't use char for memory array, use uint8_t
- Use standard bool
- Don't use static/global variables
- Prefer inline over macro
- Test your functions
- Write functions to do one thing
- Don't write systems, write modular pieces (think UNIX)
- Warnings are errors
	- Enable /Wall
	- Build 3rd party code into a lib, many libs have warnings and we can't have that with /wall and warnings as errors
- If there is a standard, use it
