title: Drawing like it's 1982 in x64 Assembly

Don't get me wrong, I've done my fair share of graphics programming in OpenGL, DirectX, and Vulkan (mostly in C), but there is something just so appealing about writing pixels directly to screen coordinates in Assembly. So as part of learning Commodore 64 memory layout and 6502 Assembly, I thought it would be neat to make something in a modern CPU architecture that would allow me to write some colors to memory and make games in a more old school way. For this I decided to write something up in x64 Assembly (with some help from OpenGL/GLFW C functions) which would allow me to draw per-pixel stuff within a window.
