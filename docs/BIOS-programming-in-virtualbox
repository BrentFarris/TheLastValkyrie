There are two things I want to explain how to do here, **(1)** basic BIOS interrupts and **(2)** setting the color of pixles plotted onto the screen. This is by no means suppose to be the most performant best way to do things, but I'm running this on a 4GHz processor list most anyone else who will be trying this; so I would consider it a great first step.

If you're viewing this guide it means you probably already know what BIOS is (basic input output system) and you've probably already dabbled a bit in assembly. Both of these are technically not required since I'm going through all the steps, but knowing them probably will make the information here stick a bit better.

## Tools setup
**VirtualBox** - The first thing you are going to need is [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). You could do this stuff right on real hardware, but there are risks with doing such a thing and alos it will take an awfully long time to debug things. Using a virtual machine is helpful for rapid iteration.

**NASM** - We are going to use the [NASM assembler](https://nasm.us/) to assemble our code. You can use this assembler on whatever operating system your on. I'm going to be using Linux on Windows to assemble my code quickly. In Linux just run `sudo apt-get install nasm build-essential` to install all that you need.
