I am not that great of a carver, in fact, probably every carving you see here is the total number of carvings I've done that weren't just practice runs (plus a couple more). It is something I like doing as a hobby, it's nice to just relax and cut carve out some drawings.

My normal process that I try for these are to draw something I like in my sketchbook, then transfrer that over to a stamp block and carve it out; nothing fancy. Sometimes I'll print out the image on my printer to trace if I had done the drawing digitally, but I don't do too much of drawing digitally these days.
