## Preface
I can breathe, talk, and think like many others, but my fundamental knowledge of why and how I am doing such things is not present. To be able to achieve but not understand is the cause of my restlessness. This document serves as a personal analysis of this universe and its structures. For this reason, for those who dare to read it, you will find not one area of study, but many. I believe it is the duty of any human to continue to learn and develop our understanding of this universe from the initial breath to the final; and perhaps one day we will ultimately understand the universe that was bestowed upon us.

As potentially evident by the first section of the text, there is no order in which I am writing. The order that is presented in the text has no meaning on the concepts of future sections. While on the topic, I am referring to this document as text instead of book because there is no cohesion between the various sections (which some people might call books or chapters). Also, I am not fond of the idea of releasing this text to anyone for personal profit (which seems to be a major reason for writing books in this current era). To be completely honest I am developing this book to document the various adventures I have through many fields of study, though I dare not call it a diary, rather a scientific analysis.

This text is going to attempt to only have information within it that could be considered timeless. For this reason, I will not review any specific software, protocols, or technologies that could possibly no longer be around within a few lifetimes. Of course, some things may be selected to present common ideas through example. If something from the current time is selected, I will do my best to explain the selected object in detail so that it becomes more of a name for a complex structure than a crutch to provide a brief explanation. Moreover, it is very likely that this text will not pass the test of time, but if it does the language, we use now will be extinct or archaic at the very least; so please forgive any idioms or sarcasm that I may use throughout this text, it is a shameless habit of mine.

Note that I will purposely be leaving out subjects like English, language, and culture as those topics rapidly change as generations pass. What my government is today is not going to be the government of tomorrow. Likewise, the languages and ideas of today will be long gone within just three generations to come. Math, science, and general philosophy as it relates to the greater universe are much more long-lived topics to discuss in this text as they have existed long before man and will exist long after man has perished as a species or moved on to a different type of existence that cannot be categorized as human any longer.

Lastly, I would like to note that many discoveries have been made in my lifetime alone that contradicts proposals from many great minds in the past, so though I regurgitate the knowledge I have obtained from these great thinkers, it may be proven wrong by the time this text is read. In this way I would ask that you do not discredit this text or see that it has a loss of value, many of the discoveries I write into this text are what modern life is built upon. Rather than looking at only the result of something, you will learn much more by understanding the process that went into developing the result regardless if it is fact or fiction by the time this text is read.

## Introduction and philosophy
My biggest fear about this text is that people will jump to the sections that they care about and ignore the sections they are not interested in. This text is written so that it could (and should be) read from beginning to end without skipping any sections. It is my firm belief that all humans should be able to learn and use information across all disciplines. At the time of this writing, it is common for people to choose one role to execute and maintain in their daily lives. Anyone who, for example, were to study and practice both mathematics and art would be considered a “Renaissance Man” or “Renaissance Woman”. It is assumed that the rise in industrialism, among many other things, such as factory jobs and human based assembly lines caused us to choose one profession or skill to develop and master. The saying “Jack of all trades, master of none” was taught to me from an early age and by my peers as I continued to learn various topics. However, when we look at great historical figures, we find that many of them trained in many disciplines and the very fact that they were so well rounded may have been the cause for their genius. So, I say to those of you who dare to read this text, read with an open mind, be patient, and dare to achieve everything and nothing less.

The idea behind learning as a way of life is to take the time that has been given to us and use it to explore further into the depths of our universe and ultimately our reality. We, like all things in this universe, are made up of matter; tiny entities that are hidden to our limited vision without the aid of microscopes and imagination. This matter has been around since the first tick of our universes clock and that is the stuff we are made of. It is very possible that each of us has the same energy and matter that was possessed by some of the greatest people in history, so in a way that would make us a legacy of their existence. In the same light, when each of us die and are buried into the ground, our matter and energy will be re-consumed by other living organisms on this earth and may be obtained by the next wave of great thinkers. 

## Mathematics
Mathematics is one of the most fundamental instruments and is the language of our universe. It holds so many secrets, so many answers, and it is a remarkable privilege that we can understand such a concept. Though the subject can get very complex and has so many potentials for error, it is an essential product of our continued progression into the future. The most complicated part of mathematics is memorization and, strangely enough, the primary way of teaching or learning mathematics is through memorization currently. If this is your form of learning mathematics, then you are putting yourself through unbearable torture to become just mediocre on the subject. Mathematics is based on its usefulness and the proofs that create the formulas that, so many people cram into memory without reason. When you were a child or learning something you were extremely interested in, did you ever memorize anything? If so, then you know how frustrating and hard it is to retain that information. Now for things you truly have mastered, you may realize that you never learned that through memory, but from usage. Learning through understanding is more powerful than learning through memorization. For example, I can tell you that you can use the “Pythagorean Theorem” for right triangles to find the hypotenuse, but how does that help you with anything? It is easy to memorize and recite “a squared plus b squared is equal to c squared”, but would you know when to use it? Now if I told you that you can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance between any 2 points in space, that is something useful! What is the distance from the top of the house to a point anywhere in the yard? Well using the Pythagorean Theorem (distance formula) you can figure that out, now you know how tall of a ladder you need to get or how much wire you need for that zipline. Without further ado, let us jump right into some mathematics.

### Exponents
Exponents are the simplification of explaining a repeating multiplication for a common number. Another word that is used to describe the action is "raising ___ to the **power** of ___". For example, the following is an example of **raising 2 to the power of 3**.
<div align="center">2<sup>3</sup></div>
Notice that the 3 is a superscript next to the 2. In this case we will call the 2 our **base number**, and the 3 our **exponent** or **power**. Note that the power of 2 is often referred to as squared and the power of 3 is often referred to as Cubed. The answer for the above equation is **8** and below is how we get to this value from the equation.
<div align="center">2<sup>3</sup>=2×2×2=8</div>
You will notice that we take the base number and multiply it to itself the number of times denoted by the exponent. So, in this case our exponent is 3 so we multiply 2 by itself 3 times. This will produce the value of 8.

#### Zero and One
To understand exponents, it is important to understand the hidden part of what we are doing behind the scenes. Algebraically, if we multiply any number by 1 (one) then the number is equal to itself.
<div align="center">2<sup>3</sup>=1×2×2×2=8</div>
Notice in this example we have done the same equation as we previously have done, except this time we’ve multiplied by 1. This is essential knowledge for understanding the following equation.
<div align="center">2<sup>0</sup></div>
As you may have guessed, we can’t multiply 2 by itself 0 times because then the first instance of 2 won’t exist. However, if we think about how we must multiply 1 before we multiply the base number by the exponent, the following expression then makes sense.
<div align="center">2<sup>0</sup>=1</div>
Being that we multiply by 1 in any exponent equation, anything raised to the 0 power will equal 1. You may be tempted to think that it would be 1 multiplied by 0, but if you look at what is happening in the equation where the base number 2 was raised to the 3 power, you will notice that we multiply 1 by 3 twos. So, in this way when we have the base number 2 raised to the 0 power, we multiply 1 by 0 twos.

Now that we understand this concept, we can apply it to when we have an exponent of 1. So, based on this information, any base number raised to the power of 1 will be itself.
<div align="center">2<sup>1</sup>=1×2=2</div>

#### Negative exponents
From our previous explanations for exponents, it would make it very difficult to understand how we can multiply 1 by a negative amount of the base number. The main thing to understand is that we don’t multiply by the negative base number, remember the exponent is the number of times we multiply the base by 1. If you think of a positive number as scaling for multiplication, then you can remember that we should do what is known as the opposite of multiplication for an exponent (we need to divide).
<div align="center">2<sup>-3</sup> = 1× 1&frasl;2 × 1&frasl;2 × 1&frasl;2 = 1×1&frasl;8 = 1&frasl;8</div>
As you may have noticed, we take the reciprocal of 2 which is ½ and then do the multiplication from there. Something you might also have noticed is that 2 raised to the power of 3 is 8 and our result was 1/8. In this way we can convert the exponent to something more readable whenever we have a negative.
<div align="center">2<sup>-3</sup> = (1&frasl;2)<sup>3</sup></div>
In the previous example you will notice that we take the reciprocal of 2 and then strip the negative sign from the power of 3 to get the same result. You can also do the inverse process of this if you find that the negative exponent is easier to read, as you might agree with the following example.
<div align="center">(1&frasl;8)<sup>3</sup> = 8<sup>-3</sup></div>

#### Fractional exponents
Fractional exponents can seem quite confusing but converting them to a root may help understand them a bit better.
<div align="center">27<sup>1&frasl;3</sup> = <sup>3</sup>&radic;(27) = 3</div>
Notice that we took 1&frasl;3 and turned it into a cube root <sup>3</sup>&radic;. Likewise, if we had an exponent of 1&frasl;2 then we would end up with a square root <sup>2</sup>&radic;(27) and so on.

## Graphing
As humans, we are very visual creatures and for most of us we are not able to understand something until we can see it in one way or another. A blind person may touch your face to see how you look, a musician may write their music down on paper to see how the song flows over time, an artist will use a live prop or person to see what they wish to draw onto their page. For mathematics graphs are the pictures that help us see and further understand the behavior of the formulas and equations. There are many ways to visualize math, however the easiest to work with are the graphs that we can draw by hand in two dimensions. Sure, I can say that x=3 or y=10 but what does that mean? What does that look like and what happens if I change x to 7? When we plot these onto a graph, we can really see the numbers take shape. Let's say that I told you that I have a triangle that had a length of 3, 4, and 5. Could you possibly imagine this triangle? Is it an isosceles, equilateral, acute, obtuse, or right triangle? Now if we were given the points that make up those lengths and plotted them onto a graph you would be able to quickly and easily see that this triangle is a right triangle.

### Right triangles
Right triangles are a very useful shape when it comes not only to mathematics, but more importantly as it relates to the world and the manufactured world that we live in. If you were to just look around the room that you are in, you will no doubt see many right triangles. Every rectangular shape you see consists of at least two right triangles just by drawing a line to connect two opposite corners. Also, every corner in a wall can express an infinite number of right triangles just by drawing a line at different points from any point on the wall to the floor. So, as you can see just by those two examples, you may be able to see right triangles in everything now. These triangles are particularly useful for determining the distance of objects or defining angles between points. So, in this section we will go over the various properties of right triangles as well as the functions and formulas that can be used with them to solve real world problems.

#### Pythagorean theorem
This theorem is probably one of the most famous theorems that many children learn in school due to its very simple almost elementary song sounding formula.
<div align="center">a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup></div>
The way that we prove this formula is to take 3 geometric squares and then place them to form a right triangle. First let’s take 2 of the squares and place them touching each other at the corner forming a right angle (90° angle). Now for the 3<sup>rd</sup> square you will notice that it must be a very specific size to fit connecting the other two corners of the squares together.  This square will produce the hypotenuse of the right triangle. The length of the side of this square must be the sum of the squares that make up the other two sides. The following diagram may look complex with all the lines and points, but the main thing to notice is that there are 3 squares formed from each side of the right triangle. The square that is diagonal in the image is the square that makes up the hypotenuse and is the c variable in the above equation. The other 2 sides of the triangle are not explicit for which is a and which is b so you can interchange them and produce the same result due to the commutative property of addition.

#### Distance formula
The distance formula is a way for you to take two points and find the distance between the two points.
<div align="center">d = &radic;((x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)</sup></div>

Now the question will be, how and why does this work? Let’s imagine that we have two points &lt;2,3&gt; and &lt;6,6&gt;, and we were to plot those onto a graph.  Notice that these points are now floating around on this graph, but something you may not easily be able to notice about them is that these two points can form a right triangle. If we connect the points, we will have the hypotenuse of the right triangle. Now if we draw a line straight down the y-axis for the point &lt;6,6&gt; and then a line straight to the right on the x-axis for point &lt;2,3&gt;; the two lines will intercept and form a right triangle. Now using the Pythagorean Theorem, we could find the length of the hypotenuse (the distance between the two points). However, first we need to find the ∆s between the points. To find the delta of any value such as time, length, etc. We take the second value and subtract it from the first value. So, if I started at 2 on the x-axis and ended at 6 on the x-axis then we find the delta with 6-2(x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>), which will produce the value of 4. So now we know that the length of the side of the triangle on the bottom along the x-axis is 4. If we do the same thing for the y-axis change (y<sub>2</sub> – y<sub>1</sub>) we will get the value 3 which is the length of the side of the triangle on the side along the y-axis. Now it is a simple matter of plugging our sides a and b into the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance between the two points. Notice that when we execute each of these steps, we can deduce the distance formula from them. That is, the square root of the sum of the sides squared (the change in x<sup>2</sup> plus the change in y<sup>2</sup>) will equal the distance between the two points.

#### Finding a point given an angle and magnitude
Sometimes you have an issue where you are trying to find a point that is not vertical or horizontal from another point, instead you only know the length and the angle in degrees that the point should be in from your current position. The following image shows 2 points plotted on a graph (2, 2) and (6, 5). Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we know that the hypotenuse is 5.

![figure finding-a-point-given-an-angle-and-magnitude-1](https://i.imgur.com/xF22sYA.jpg)

Now imagine that we would want to find the other 2 points that make up a square using these 2 points. We know that a square has the same length on all sides, and we found the length of one side using a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>, which means all other sides must have a length of 5. First off, we know that each corner of a square is 90° from Geometry (angles of all corners add up to 360° in any quad, since a square is symmetrical, we do 360&frasl;4). What we currently don’t know is the angle of the right triangle formed by a, b, and the point where they intersect. To get this angle we will use Trigonometry. For the sake of clarity, let’s first pull in an image of this imaginary right triangle and its side lengths.

![figure finding-a-point-given-an-angle-and-magnitude-2](https://i.imgur.com/2zK1nKE.jpg)

At this point we want to find the angle at the top right of the triangle so that we can add it to the 90° that we discussed. We have the lengths for all the sides, so we can pick any equation we want from SOH-CAH-TOA. I will pick SOH to find the angle [sin(opposite ÷ hypotenuse)] so the equation will become the following.
<div align="center">sin<sup>-1</sup>(1&frasl;4)=53.13°</div>
Now that we have the angle of the top right corner of the triangle, we will add that to the 90° of the bottom corner of the square that is adjacent to this angle.
<div align="center">Θ=90°+53.13°=143.13°</div>
Note that since this is a square, we only need to find 1 point, then use that delta to plot the other point. Below is the formula required to calculate this point. The *magnitude* is 5 and Θ is the angle in degrees we’ve calculated (in this case 143.13°).
<div align="center">x = magnitude × cosΘ=5 × cos(143.13) ≈ 5(-0.79) ≈ -3.99</div>
<div align="center">y = magnitude × sinΘ=5 × sin(143.13) ≈ 5 × 0.6 ≈ 3</div>
Now if you were to plot out these points on our given diagram you will obviously not get a square. There is one more thing we need to do and that is to add the offset of the x and y of our points to these values. So, since we are dealing with the top right point, we will need to add 6 and 5 respectively.
<div align="center">p = &lt;x+6, y+5&gt; = &lt;2.01, 8&gt;</div>
![figure finding-a-point-given-an-angle-and-magnitude-3](https://i.imgur.com/OYA81n4.jpg)

From this point you can do one of 2 things to find the other point of the square. One being you perform the same actions we’ve done up to this point except for the bottom left point of the triangle, or you can simply use the delta between the two points of the triangle that make up the edge of the square.
<div align="center">x = 2.01 - 4 = - 2.01</div>
![figure finding-a-point-given-an-angle-and-magnitude-4](https://i.imgur.com/7YZhHlk.jpg)

The previous image is the completed square which we were able to create from just two plotted points. As this section is about finding the point projected from an angle given a desired angle, this can be used for almost anything involving angles and finding points based on that because the real magic of this is being able to project in a direction based on a specific angle. Though we created a square we can create other shapes using this logic or even just project and plot any number of positions based on angles.

### Trigonometry

#### Unit circle

#### Calculating sine, cosine, and tangent functions

#### Picking between sine, cosine, and tangent functions

#### Angle between two points
Finding the angle from 0 between two points is important for many things, however one that comes up often is to know how much to rotate something at point a so that it is facing point b. Let’s consider a=&lt;1,1&gt; and b=&lt;5,5&gt; to keep things simple. The graph below would represent the segment that is formed from these two points.

![figure angle-between-two-points-1](https://i.imgur.com/FYjEZCL.png)

If we create a right triangle from the two points by drawing in their sides, we will be able to get the angle of point a. We also know the length of the 2 sides we create by getting the difference of the components for sides n and m.
