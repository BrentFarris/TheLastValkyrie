## Preface
I can breathe, talk, and think like many others, but my fundamental knowledge of why and how I am doing such things is not present. To be able to achieve but not understand is the cause of my restlessness. This document serves as a personal analysis of this universe and its structures. For this reason, for those who dare to read it, you will find not one area of study, but many. I believe it is the duty of any human to continue to learn and develop our understanding of this universe from the initial breath to the final; and perhaps one day we will ultimately understand the universe that was bestowed upon us.

As potentially evident by the first section of the text, there is no order in which I am writing. The order that is presented in the text has no meaning on the concepts of future sections. While on the topic, I am referring to this document as text instead of book because there is no cohesion between the various sections (which some people might call books or chapters). Also, I am not fond of the idea of releasing this text to anyone for personal profit (which seems to be a major reason for writing books in this current era). To be completely honest I am developing this book to document the various adventures I have through many fields of study, though I dare not call it a diary, rather a scientific analysis.

This text is going to attempt to only have information within it that could be considered timeless. For this reason, I will not review any specific software, protocols, or technologies that could possibly no longer be around within a few lifetimes. Of course, some things may be selected to present common ideas through example. If something from the current time is selected, I will do my best to explain the selected object in detail so that it becomes more of a name for a complex structure than a crutch to provide a brief explanation. Moreover, it is very likely that this text will not pass the test of time, but if it does the language, we use now will be extinct or archaic at the very least; so please forgive any idioms or sarcasm that I may use throughout this text, it is a shameless habit of mine.

Note that I will purposely be leaving out subjects like English, language, and culture as those topics rapidly change as generations pass. What my government is today is not going to be the government of tomorrow. Likewise, the languages and ideas of today will be long gone within just three generations to come. Math, science, and general philosophy as it relates to the greater universe are much more long-lived topics to discuss in this text as they have existed long before man and will exist long after man has perished as a species or moved on to a different type of existence that cannot be categorized as human any longer.

Lastly, I would like to note that many discoveries have been made in my lifetime alone that contradicts proposals from many great minds in the past, so though I regurgitate the knowledge I have obtained from these great thinkers, it may be proven wrong by the time this text is read. In this way I would ask that you do not discredit this text or see that it has a loss of value, many of the discoveries I write into this text are what modern life is built upon. Rather than looking at only the result of something, you will learn much more by understanding the process that went into developing the result regardless if it is fact or fiction by the time this text is read.

## Introduction and philosophy
My biggest fear about this text is that people will jump to the sections that they care about and ignore the sections they are not interested in. This text is written so that it could (and should be) read from beginning to end without skipping any sections. It is my firm belief that all humans should be able to learn and use information across all disciplines. At the time of this writing, it is common for people to choose one role to execute and maintain in their daily lives. Anyone who, for example, were to study and practice both mathematics and art would be considered a “Renaissance Man” or “Renaissance Woman”. It is assumed that the rise in industrialism, among many other things, such as factory jobs and human based assembly lines caused us to choose one profession or skill to develop and master. The saying “Jack of all trades, master of none” was taught to me from an early age and by my peers as I continued to learn various topics. However, when we look at great historical figures, we find that many of them trained in many disciplines and the very fact that they were so well rounded may have been the cause for their genius. So, I say to those of you who dare to read this text, read with an open mind, be patient, and dare to achieve everything and nothing less.

The idea behind learning as a way of life is to take the time that has been given to us and use it to explore further into the depths of our universe and ultimately our reality. We, like all things in this universe, are made up of matter; tiny entities that are hidden to our limited vision without the aid of microscopes and imagination. This matter has been around since the first tick of our universes clock and that is the stuff we are made of. It is very possible that each of us has the same energy and matter that was possessed by some of the greatest people in history, so in a way that would make us a legacy of their existence. In the same light, when each of us die and are buried into the ground, our matter and energy will be re-consumed by other living organisms on this earth and may be obtained by the next wave of great thinkers. 

## Mathematics
Mathematics is one of the most fundamental instruments and is the language of our universe. It holds so many secrets, so many answers, and it is a remarkable privilege that we can understand such a concept. Though the subject can get very complex and has so many potentials for error, it is an essential product of our continued progression into the future. The most complicated part of mathematics is memorization and, strangely enough, the primary way of teaching or learning mathematics is through memorization currently. If this is your form of learning mathematics, then you are putting yourself through unbearable torture to become just mediocre on the subject. Mathematics is based on its usefulness and the proofs that create the formulas that, so many people cram into memory without reason. When you were a child or learning something you were extremely interested in, did you ever memorize anything? If so, then you know how frustrating and hard it is to retain that information. Now for things you truly have mastered, you may realize that you never learned that through memory, but from usage. Learning through understanding is more powerful than learning through memorization. For example, I can tell you that you can use the “Pythagorean Theorem” for right triangles to find the hypotenuse, but how does that help you with anything? It is easy to memorize and recite “a squared plus b squared is equal to c squared”, but would you know when to use it? Now if I told you that you can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance between any 2 points in space, that is something useful! What is the distance from the top of the house to a point anywhere in the yard? Well using the Pythagorean Theorem (distance formula) you can figure that out, now you know how tall of a ladder you need to get or how much wire you need for that zipline. Without further ado, let us jump right into some mathematics.

### Exponents
Exponents are the simplification of explaining a repeating multiplication for a common number. Another word that is used to describe the action is "raising ___ to the **power** of ___". For example, the following is an example of **raising 2 to the power of 3**.
<div align="center">2<sup>3</sup></div>
Notice that the 3 is a superscript next to the 2. In this case we will call the 2 our **base number**, and the 3 our **exponent** or **power**. Note that the power of 2 is often referred to as squared and the power of 3 is often referred to as Cubed. The answer for the above equation is **8** and below is how we get to this value from the equation.
<div align="center">2<sup>3</sup>=2×2×2=8</div>
You will notice that we take the base number and multiply it to itself the number of times denoted by the exponent. So, in this case our exponent is 3 so we multiply 2 by itself 3 times. This will produce the value of 8.

#### Zero and One
To understand exponents, it is important to understand the hidden part of what we are doing behind the scenes. Algebraically, if we multiply any number by 1 (one) then the number is equal to itself.
<div align="center">2<sup>3</sup>=1×2×2×2=8</div>
Notice in this example we have done the same equation as we previously have done, except this time we’ve multiplied by 1. This is essential knowledge for understanding the following equation.
<div align="center">2<sup>0</sup></div>
As you may have guessed, we can’t multiply 2 by itself 0 times because then the first instance of 2 won’t exist. However, if we think about how we must multiply 1 before we multiply the base number by the exponent, the following expression then makes sense.
<div align="center">2<sup>0</sup>=1</div>
Being that we multiply by 1 in any exponent equation, anything raised to the 0 power will equal 1. You may be tempted to think that it would be 1 multiplied by 0, but if you look at what is happening in the equation where the base number 2 was raised to the 3 power, you will notice that we multiply 1 by 3 twos. So, in this way when we have the base number 2 raised to the 0 power, we multiply 1 by 0 twos.

Now that we understand this concept, we can apply it to when we have an exponent of 1. So, based on this information, any base number raised to the power of 1 will be itself.
<div align="center">2<sup>1</sup>=1×2=2</div>

#### Negative exponents
From our previous explanations for exponents, it would make it very difficult to understand how we can multiply 1 by a negative amount of the base number. The main thing to understand is that we don’t multiply by the negative base number, remember the exponent is the number of times we multiply the base by 1. If you think of a positive number as scaling for multiplication, then you can remember that we should do what is known as the opposite of multiplication for an exponent (we need to divide).
<div align="center">2<sup>-3</sup> = 1× 1&frasl;2 × 1&frasl;2 × 1&frasl;2 = 1×1&frasl;8 = 1&frasl;8</div>
As you may have noticed, we take the reciprocal of 2 which is ½ and then do the multiplication from there. Something you might also have noticed is that 2 raised to the power of 3 is 8 and our result was 1/8. In this way we can convert the exponent to something more readable whenever we have a negative.
<div align="center">2<sup>-3</sup> = (1&frasl;2)<sup>3</sup></div>
In the previous example you will notice that we take the reciprocal of 2 and then strip the negative sign from the power of 3 to get the same result. You can also do the inverse process of this if you find that the negative exponent is easier to read, as you might agree with the following example.
<div align="center">(1&frasl;8)<sup>3</sup> = 8<sup>-3</sup></div>

#### Fractional exponents
Fractional exponents can seem quite confusing but converting them to a root may help understand them a bit better.
<div align="center">27<sup>1&frasl;3</sup> = <sup>3</sup>&radic;(27) = 3</div>
Notice that we took 1&frasl;3 and turned it into a cube root <sup>3</sup>&radic;. Likewise, if we had an exponent of 1&frasl;2 then we would end up with a square root <sup>2</sup>&radic;(27) and so on.

## Graphing
As humans, we are very visual creatures and for most of us we are not able to understand something until we can see it in one way or another. A blind person may touch your face to see how you look, a musician may write their music down on paper to see how the song flows over time, an artist will use a live prop or person to see what they wish to draw onto their page. For mathematics graphs are the pictures that help us see and further understand the behavior of the formulas and equations. There are many ways to visualize math, however the easiest to work with are the graphs that we can draw by hand in two dimensions. Sure, I can say that x=3 or y=10 but what does that mean? What does that look like and what happens if I change x to 7? When we plot these onto a graph, we can really see the numbers take shape. Let's say that I told you that I have a triangle that had a length of 3, 4, and 5. Could you possibly imagine this triangle? Is it an isosceles, equilateral, acute, obtuse, or right triangle? Now if we were given the points that make up those lengths and plotted them onto a graph you would be able to quickly and easily see that this triangle is a right triangle.
