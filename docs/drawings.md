I have yet to make any original art, but here are some drawings I've done while practicing. Some are from life but many are based on other artists I like (I guess you can call it fan art) and some random drawings I've seen that I liked a piece of and wanted to try myself.

I really like Kim Jung Gi's style and have been drawing a lot only with a sharpie recently so here are some drawings from those exercises.

I don't do much digital drawing as of late but here is one I did. I do like the undo button, but I hate it at the same time!
