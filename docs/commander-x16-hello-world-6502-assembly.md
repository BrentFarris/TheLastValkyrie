I am spoiled by visual studio (where I develop x86 and x64 assembly code) for windows or use the ARM tools on Linux. I searched through the Facebook group here for a very simple 0-to-running hello world tutorial for 6502 Assembly but only mainly got bits and pieces. So after being up until 3am I finally got a program running in the emulator using 6502 assembly (all of 3 lines but it is a start). Now that I figured out how to go from 0 to running a program in the emulator I thought I would share it for all those I've seen asking about getting a program up and working in 6502 assembly.

**Note 1:** While C is my favorite programming language, and I have a lot of experience in it, all the fun in this for me is to write Assembly code by hand on such a limited CPU.

**Note 2:**  While I show everything you need to write a 6502 assembly program and get it running in the Commander X16 emulator, I have a few questions in this video for anyone who can give me a solid answer :)
