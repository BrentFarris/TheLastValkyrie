I've been having some fun writing a Game Boy game with a co-worker, nothing fancy, just for fun to learn more about the Game Boy and teaching my co-worker how to write games for it in assembly. One of the problems we have is that the tools we use to debug the code are a little difficult to use. Basically you have to run it in an emulator/debugger like No$GMB and then hit break points and review the state of the device. I thought it would be really cool to just write assertions directly into the assembly code and have it tell me when things are wrong. Basically like unit testing the Game Boy code.

So I wrote both a non-graphical **emulator** and a custom **assembler** for the Game Boy.
