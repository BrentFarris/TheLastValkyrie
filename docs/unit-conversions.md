Sometimes you need to keep a collection of unit conversions and some quick details on them for later. I'll continue updating this page as I add more conversions to my needed list.

## Celsius to fahrenheit
At 0° Celsius we would have 32° Fahrenheit, and at 100° Celsius we would have 180° Fahrenheit. We can convert this into the equation as follows 100&frasl;180 + 32 = 9&frasl;5 + 32 = 1.8 + 32 which we can then convert into the function:
<div align="center">f(x) = 1.8x + 32</div>
The logic behind this equation is that water freezes at 0° Celsius and boils at 100° Celsius. In Fahrenheit, water freezes at 32° and boils at 212°. The offset of 32 would turn 212° to 180°.

## Fahrenheit to celsius
The conversion process from Fahrenheit to Celsius is the opposite of the process above. The function for this would be:
<div align="center">f(x) = (x - 32) ÷ 1.8</div>
