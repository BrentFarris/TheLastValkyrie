Something I've been really wanting to do is to create a simple game in Assembly (or any assembly language for that matter). One of the problems I was having was trying to figure out what platform I wanted to create the game for. My ideal platform would be a 16-bit platform because I loved that era of games, but at the same time, I want to be able to use modern tools and debuggers. I think the next best thing would just be to develop a game on a modern CPU; so I decided that I'll just assemble my game for the x64 architecture.

TBD
