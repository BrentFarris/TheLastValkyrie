I've been developing a game engine for fun for years. It's bobbed back and forth in C and C++ and has been similar to a framework the whole time (pure code). I decided to play around and try to add a GUI to visualize all the game engine code using GTK. Below are a series of updates of some stuff I've been messing with in the engine (mostly related to the GUI stuff).

TBD
