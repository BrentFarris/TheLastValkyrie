I love the Casio fx-991CW calculator, but I have one particular issue with it. That is that it doesn't have long term storage for the spreadsheet and equations. The calculator does have a QR code export though. This video goes over the reverse engineering I did for the QR code encoding on the calculator to create a program to add off-device long-term storage. The ClassWiz website for the Casio calculators is nice, but who knows if it will be around a decade from now, so I'd like to add an alternative way to save and review things I make on the calculator.

One day I'll come back and make a writeup for this, but for now here's the video going over it.
