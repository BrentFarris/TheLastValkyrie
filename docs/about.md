Born in 1990 in a very rural part of Oklahoma I spent my early days playing my NES and Super Nintendo, making stop motion animations with video cameras, and playing through those mind game books. In high school I taught myself guitar and piano, then went to college for 2D animation. While in college, I decided to make a video game and learned my first programming language which was C++. I started working as a developer in 2011 in business software development and recently have been involved in mobile and desktop video game development.

I spend my free time drawing, animating, playing music, learning about electronics and old computer systems, and spending time with my wife. I believe that life is more about experiences and discovery, both with people and in learning, and not so much about money.
